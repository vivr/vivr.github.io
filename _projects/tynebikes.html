	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>This project was for an organisation campaigning for better facilities for cyclists in and around Tyneside. The brief was for a website and branding redesign.</p>
	<h3>Approach</h3>
	<p>The organisation needed a method of managing site content so it was decided to use a PHP and MySQL CMS solution. The old site had lots of fragmented and unorganised content and was difficult to navigate. I created a site map to show the new organisation of information and then designed the page layouts focusing on ease of use across all devices.</p>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>This project was completed in a total of 3 months, originally the site would be run on a custom CMS built with PHP and MySql, however, later in the process it was decided to use Wordpress because of ease of use and its popularity.</p>
