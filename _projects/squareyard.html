	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>This was for an art gallery run by Newcastle College, primarily for creative practice students. They were looking for a site to exhibit the work of professional contemporary artists and designers as well as to promote exhibitions and events held at the gallery.</p>
	<h3>Approach</h3>
	<p>After the initial client research I produced high fidelity wireframes to establish how the site was going to work. The visual design is clean and simple to emphasise the art work. I created a customised Wordpress child theme and set up plugins to allow for easy addition of images and gallery sections to the site.</p>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>The project was completed within 2 months and was designed to be viewed on desktops, tablets and smartphones. In addition, I produced a user manual and provided basic training for the client to get started using Wordpress.</p>
