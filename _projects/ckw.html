	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>CKW is an imports and exports trading company who wanted a redesign of their existing website with the primary objective of promoting the companies services.</p>
	<h3>Approach</h3>
	<p>After discussing project deliverables with the client it was decided that the best solution would be to remove some unnecessary content pages and build a one page site showing their main services. Talking extensively with the client allowed me to understand how the website should work and helped me develop a clear vision of how the redesigned site should look and feel.</p>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>The redesign is built on HTML and CSS.</p>
