	<h3>Scope</h3>
	<p>AIS Baltic enlisted my help to promote their new venture into the import and export of perfume products.</p>
	<h3>Approach</h3>
	<p>After researching the industry and discussing objectives with the client I decided on a simple wire frame and built a prototype. I focused very much on the visual language of the website to ensure that it looked and felt consistent with the company's existing branding.</p>
	<h3>Production</h3>
	<p>The project was completed in a total of 2 months. The site was designed with HTML, CSS, PHP and JavaScript and used the Foundation framework.</p>
